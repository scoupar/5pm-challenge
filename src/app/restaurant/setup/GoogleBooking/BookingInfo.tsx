        <p>
          Please note that if you have payment / credit card capture feature
          enabled for enforced rule requirements, the Reserve with Google
          feature does not enforce this for customers at the time of booking.
          The customer will receive an email with the link to securely supply
          requirements. If the requirement is not met by the specified due date
          outlined in the rule, this will be auto-cancelled in your diary. You
          can monitor the status of payment required bookings here.
